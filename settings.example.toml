# Settings example
# Do not edit this file directly, instead, copy the following as `settings.toml` and edit that file.

# These settings can also be overriden by:
# - Environment variables
#   e.g. `COMFY_SCRIPT_TRANSPILE_HOOK_ENABLED=false`
# - Python code
#   e.g.
#   ```python
#   from comfy_script.config import settings
#   settings.transpile.hook.enabled=False
#   ```

[transpile.hook]
# When ComfyScript is installed as custom nodes, `SaveImage` and similar nodes will be hooked to automatically save the script as the image's metadata. The script will also be printed to the terminal.
# To disable a feature, change its value to `false`.
