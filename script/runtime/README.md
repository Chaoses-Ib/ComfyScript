## Other differences from ComfyUI's web UI
- No limitations on input precision and range.

  For example, in the web UI, `ImageScaleBy`'s `scale_by` has a minimum precision of 0.01, it is not possible to use a value like `0.375`, but only `0.38` (even if the workflow is generated by ComfyScript). But in ComfyScript, there is no such limitations.
